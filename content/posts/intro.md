Hello world ğŸ‘‹ !

This page is purely a fake one to test if I can make funny things here ğŸ˜€

I'm using this Hugo template [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) just to see if I can easily make a dev blog, with ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·/ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ translation in no time.

Let's see how this will work and what will come after !
